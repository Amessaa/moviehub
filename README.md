# MOVIEHUB - Movie Library Website


# Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the movie library website, which is developed using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The website integrates an open-source free API database of movies, allowing users to browse and search for movies. The API includes details such as release date, genre, plot, writer, actors, and ratings for each movie.

# Features

1. Movie Database Integration
The movie website utilizes an API database to fetch movie information, including titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and descriptions. The API endpoints are accessed via JavaScript's fetch function, and the data is dynamically displayed on the website.

2. Theme Changing Feature
The website includes a theme-changing feature that allows users to switch between different visual themes. This feature is implemented using CSS variables, and JavaScript is used to handle the theme-switching functionality. Users can select their preferred theme from a predefined set of options.

3. Dynamic Arrow Navigators
To enhance user navigation, the website incorporates dynamic arrow navigators. These navigators appear when there is content to scroll horizontally, such as movie carousels or slideshows. Users can click the arrow buttons to navigate through the content.

4. Search Bar
The website provides a search bar that allows users to search for movies based on keywords or specific criteria. The search functionality is implemented using JavaScript, which sends requests to the API database and displays the search results dynamically on the webpage.
